# Ecotracker
Ecotracker is a web application that uses Google Maps to calculate the three best route between two points,
and then uses fuel emissions data for a variety of car types to estimate the enviromental impact of a trip and suggest the optimal route based on enviromental impact and travel time. 
Created as a submission for SigmaHacks3.
