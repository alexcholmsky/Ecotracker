                <font size="+2" ><strong>First of all: Drive only when needed </strong><br></font>
                <p>There’s no better way to reduce fuel consumption than not driving your car. If you only need to travel a short distance, opt for a cleaner ride like walking or biking. It’ll save money, help get in that exercise, and keep you healthy!</p>

                <font size="+2" ><strong>Avoid idling. </strong><br></font>
                <p>When your car is running (but not moving) your gas mileage is absolute zero. So if your car will remain stationary for more than a minute or so, switch the engine off. Remember to only do this when it is safe to do so!</p>

        <div class="col-lg-11 p-3 p-lg-5 pt-lg-3 align-items-center">
            <p>Make sure the gas cap is on tight. Did you know 147 million gallons of gas are lost each year due to evaporation? Why did it evaporate? The gas cap was not tight!</p>

                <font size="+2" ><strong>Keep the windows closed. </strong><br></font>
                <p>Keeping your windows down while driving creates more drag and wind resistance for your automobile. It is usually okay to keep windows down at speeds of less than 35 mph.</p>

            <div id="section_1">
                <font size="+2" ><strong>Use cruise control on the highways. </strong><br></font>
                <p>Cruise control means that your car will be going at a constant velocity, which means there is no acceleration. No acceleration reduces the amount of work your engine does, and therefore it uses less gas.</p>
